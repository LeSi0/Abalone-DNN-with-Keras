# Abalone-DNN-with-Keras
Dataprocessing and DNN model for class predicion of Abalone snails dataset using Keras.

I decided to crate the DNN model using Keras framework of popular Abalone dataset.

To run this code you have to install TensorFlow, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and MatplotLob.

I perform this code as fast PoC development with shortest code snipets as posible and scientific approcach with comments and fast basic data mining.
